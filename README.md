# Stock Breakout Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze historical stock data to identify breakout patterns in stock prices. Breakout patterns are crucial for investors and traders to make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks. By analyzing historical stock data, we can identify instances where a stock's price breaks out of its recent trading range.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Run the provided scripts to collect and analyze stock data.

## Data Collection

We collect historical stock data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) using the `yfinance` library. The collected data includes the stock's open, high, low, close prices, adjusted close prices, and volume.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data undergoes preprocessing to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis. This includes:

- Converting date columns to datetime format.
- Sorting data by date in ascending order.
- Calculating rolling indicators (e.g., 55-day high and low).

## Analysis

The main analysis focuses on identifying breakout patterns in stock prices. We use various criteria, including rolling indicators and historical price data, to determine breakout days.

## Results

The project provides insights into breakout patterns in historical stock data. The results include:

- A DataFrame with breakout days identified.
- Visualizations, such as line plots, showing breakout points on stock price charts.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `yfinance`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:
